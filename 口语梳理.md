## Work or studies

**1. Do you work or are you a student?**

**2. What subjects are you studying?**

主修软件工程，想成为程序员和拥有自己的公司。不得不说，课程比我想象的复杂，但我会坚持

> I'm majoring in Software Engineering because I want to become a programmer, and have my own IT company down the road. I have to say, the courses are much more complex than I expected. But, I'm hanging in there.

**3. Do you like your subject?**

当然，我想成为程序员，因为使用软件科技帮助社会有意义，课程有用，打基础

> Absolutely, like I said, I want to become a programmer in the future because I think that it makes sense to use software technology to help society develop better. All the courses I have taken at college are super useful, and are building up my foundation to achieve that goal.

**4. Why did you choose to study that subject?**

> see 2 or 3

**5. Is it very interesting?**

**6. Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?**

早上，更清醒和好心情，读些文章是一天的好的开始

**7. Are you looking forward to working?**

是的，应用理论知识到实践中，花父母钱，是时候赚钱并回报

**8. What technology do you use when you study?**

硬件笔记本，软件IDE，提供简单完整的开发环境

> In terms of hardware, I use my laptop the most. For software, it must be VScode, Pycharm and Intellij IDEA. In programming, we need develop applications on IDE, which means integrated development environment. They provide a simple and complete platform for us to develop.

## Home/accommodation

**1. Do you live in a house or a flat?**

三居室，大多都住公寓，人口多，好选择，看不到house

> I live in a three-bedroom apartment. I mean, most Chinese people live in an apartment. Because we have such a large population, living in apartment buildings that are closer to work is the ideal option. You can rarely find any houses in the city.

**2. Can you describe the place where you live?**

北京有很多资源和机会

> Well, I live in Beijing, the capital city of China. It has quite a few resources with lots of opportunities. 

**3. How long have you lived there?**

10平米小房间，双人床，桌子，电竞椅。太小没橱柜，也没有海报和镜子因为妈

> I have a small room about 10 square meters in size. There is a queen bed, a desk, my gaming chair, and that’s about it. It does not have a walk-in closet due to its small size. Oh, and there isn’t any poster or mirror because my mom does not allow me to hang anything on the wall.

**5. What part of your home do you like the most?**

客厅，大电视，坐在沙发上和父母看电影很享受

> Definitely the living room. We just upgraded our TV to a 75 inch 8k OLED TV which cost us thousands of dollars. Sitting on our **comfy** leather couch and watching our favourite movie with my parents is super enjoyable.

**6. Who do you live with?**

在学期和舍友住，假期和父母，毕业有钱自己住，珍视隐私

> I’m still a student, so I live with dorm mates during the semester. On holidays, I will live with my parents and spend valuable time with them. However, I’m pretty sure I would want to live by myself once I’m graduated and able to afford a place. I value privacy a lot.

没住过，要铲草坪、维护、铲雪，flat不需要担心，有物业，我很忙做不了

> I’m not so sure about what it is like living in a house because I have never lived in a house before. But I do feel that there is lots of housework to do living in a house, like mowing the lawn, maintaining fixtures, shoveling the snow, just to name a few. You don’t need to worry about any of those living in a flat since the strata will take care of it. As a busy person myself, I’m not ready for all those extra housework.

**12. Are the transport facilities to your home very good?**

北京好，公交地铁很近，随便去，共享单车，

> I’ve honestly been very satisfied with transportation in Beijing. There’re many buses and subway lines very close-by. I can get to wherever I need to go pretty easily. I also really like the shared bikes in Beijing. They make it pretty easy for me to get around.

**13. What kind of house or flat do you want to live in in the future?**

现代公寓，home自动化，智能家庭让我感觉是个boss，问虚拟助手打开或关闭某个电器

> I want to live in a modern apartment with all the bells and whistles, all the most up-to-date technology like home automation. I think having a smart home can really make me feel like that I’m a boss at home because I can simply ask the virtual assistant to turn on and off a certain appliance.

**14. What's your favorite room in your apartment/house?**

> See 5.

**15. What makes you feel pleasant in your home?**

跟家人一起度过，学习远离家，只在假期回家，不在父母身边感到孤独，珍视我们的movie nights

> Spending time with family for sure. I’m studying far away from home, so I only visit family during the holidays. I already feel that I’m spending so little time with my parents, and they are getting lonely when I’m not around. Now, I really treasure our movie nights at home!

**16. What's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?**

比之前的清净，人比之前少，成长的公寓，都是大家庭成员

> The place where I am living in now is much quieter than where I lived before. The apartment I am living in now does not have as many people living in as where I grew up. In the apartment where I grew up, I was surrounded by all the members of my large family.

**17. Do you think it is important to live in a comfortable environment?**

当然，怎么有人想要在不舒服的环境中生活，舒适的环境可以更专注、冷静和幸福

> No doubt! This question is weird. Why on earth would anyone want to live in an uncomfortable environment? A comfy place will allow you to focus better and make you calm, and more importantly, happier!

## Hometown

**1. Where is your hometown?**

200w小城市，中国中部的城市中心，没风景，但有人情

> My hometown is a small industrial city called Jingmen with about 2 million people. It’s an inner city located in central China that does not have any beautiful scenery. But we do have very nice people, so I still like living there.

**2. Is that a big city or a small place?**

地理上很大，但都居住在市中心就很小，剩下的是农田

人，热情好客，放松，享受低成本慢节奏生活，在公园尽情跳舞

**5. Is there anything you dislike about it?**

虽然发展很快，没有高薪工作，5000元/月，很难省钱买车、房

> Although the city has been growing quite rapidly in recent years, there aren’t many high paying jobs. Most people make about 5,000 RMB a month which is about $1,000, so it’s still quite difficult to save enough money for a car or a house.

**6. How long have you been living there?**

12年，走出舒适区搬到北京寻找更多机会

**15. What are some changes in the area recently?**

北京搬好几次，上次5年前，忙于学习，没时间了解

**2. What electronic devices have you bought lately?**

> I just upgraded my iPhone to iPhone 14 about a month ago; I think the features and specifications are already kinda overkill for my daily use. I have no plan to upgrade other electronic devices in the next two years or so.

## Weather

**1. What's the weather like where you live?**

> The city I live in has a continental climate which means it has distinct four seasons. Temperatures could vary a lot; it could go up to 40 degrees Celsius in the summer and could reach minus 10 in the winter months. Most people like the weather, but I think it’s too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. Actually, I’m thinking about moving to another city.

**2. Do you prefer cold or hot weather**

> Neither. I hate about sweating when it’s hot outside, and I also hate about the lack of green and colorful in the middle of freezing winter. I like mild weather with plenty of sunshine.

**3. Do you prefer dry or wet weather?**

> If I have to choose one, I will go for dry weather. I have lived in both dry and humid places; the humid weather makes my clothes always stick on my body, and I feel like I have to work harder to breathe. Dry weather isn’t the best, but I think it’s much more manageable. A humidifier at home and body creams can mostly solve all the negatives.

**4. Do you get in the habit of checking the weather forecast? When/How often?**

> I don’t really have the habit. I only check the weather forecast when I’m planning a trip, especially in the winter. I need to make sure that I’m not taking the risk of driving in winter storms without proper tires and equipment.

## Public tranportation

**1. What kind of public transportation do you usually take?**

> Well, I’m not sure if shared bikes are a type of public transportation or not, but I do use that very often, it is very convenient to travel between different places on campus. For other times, I don’t use buses because the system in my city is poorly designed. Bus schedules are not reliable. I take uber rides instead.

**2. When do you usually take public transportation, in your everyday life or when you are travelling?**

> When I’m travelling, for sure. From my experience, I was able to take public transportation to most tourist attractions. And it’s just much cheaper to take buses or trains than to hire a cab or rent a car

**3. Do most people prefer public transportation in your country?**

> I can’t say for the entire country, but from my understanding, most people would love to take public transportation if it is feasible. Fortunately, in Beijing, people can rely on public transportation because the system is well designed. 

**4. Did you take public transportation when you were a kid?**

>Almost every day. I lived quite far from the school I went to, so I had to take buses to go to school every day. I still remember how crowded it was on the bus and the weird smell that made me sick. It was like a nightmare.

## Birthday

**1. What do you usually do on your birthday?**

>Nothing special really. My friends will host a birthday party for me. I will receive some birthday presents, and we will enjoy a good meal and a cake together. That’s about it.

**2. What did you do on your birthday when you were young?**

> See 1.

**3. Do you think it is important for you to celebrate your birthday?**

>For myself, it is not important at all. I used to love celebrating my birthday when I was a kid because I could receive presents and eat cakes, and I really wanted to grow up. Now, I don’t want to remind myself that I’m getting older, and I also could not enjoy my cake because I’m trying to lose weight.

**4. Whose birthday do you think is the most important to celebrate in China?**

>Mostly children’s birthday. Everyone loves to see the genuine smile on children’s face.
