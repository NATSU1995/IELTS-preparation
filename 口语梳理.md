# P1必考题

## Work or studies

**1. Do you work or are you a student?**

> Well. I'm a full time college student at Beijing Jiaotong University. I'm planning to study abroad, and that's why I'm taking the test today.

**2. What subjects are you studying?**

> I'm majoring in Software Engineering because I want to become a programmer, and have my own IT company down the road. I have to say, the courses are much more complex than I expected. But, I'm hanging in there.

**3. Do you like your subject?**

> Absolutely, like I said, I want to become a programmer in the future because I think that it makes sense to use software technology to help society develop better. All the courses I have taken at college are super useful, and are building up my foundation to achieve that goal.

**4. Why did you choose to study that subject?**

> see 2 or 3

**5. Is it very interesting?**

> Absolutely, programming is much more than typing the code. In fact, it's the foundation of almost all the technological products we can see today. It allows people to enjoy convenience and happiness.

**6. Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?**

> I actually prefer to study in the mornings. People tend to have a quite clear mind and a good mood in the morning. So by reading some delightful articles I can have a good start of my day.

**7. Are you looking forward to working?**

> Yes, of course. I cannot wait to **apply my theoretical knowledge into practice**. Also, I have spent so much of my parents’ money throughout my education. It’s time to make some money and perhaps **give back to them**.

**8. What technology do you use when you study?**

> In terms of hardware, I use my laptop the most. For software, it must be VScode, Pycharm and Intellij IDEA. In programming, we need develop applications on IDE, which means integrated development environment. They provide a simple and complete platform for us to develop.

## Home/accommodation

**1. Do you live in a house or a flat?**

> I live in a three-bedroom apartment. I mean, most Chinese people live in an apartment. Because we have such a large population, living in apartment buildings that are closer to work is the ideal option. You can rarely find any houses in the city.

**2. Can you describe the place where you live?**

> Well, I live in Beijing, the capital city of China. It has quite a few resources with lots of opportunities. 

**3. How long have you lived there?**

> I have been living there for 10 years. Since I was in grade 5, I transferred to Beijing to continue my studies.

**4. Please describe the room you live in.**

> I have a small room about 10 square meters in size. There is a queen bed, a desk, my gaming chair, and that’s about it. It does not have a walk-in closet due to its small size. Oh, and there isn’t any poster or mirror because my mom does not allow me to hang anything on the wall.

**5. What part of your home do you like the most?**

> Definitely the living room. We just upgraded our TV to a 75 inch 8k OLED TV which cost us thousands of dollars. Sitting on our **comfy** leather couch and watching our favourite movie with my parents is super enjoyable.

**6. Who do you live with?**

> I’m still a student, so I live with dorm mates during the semester. On holidays, I will live with my parents and spend valuable time with them. However, I’m pretty sure I would want to live by myself once I’m graduated and able to afford a place. I value privacy a lot.

**7. What room does your family spend most of the time in?**

> See 5.

**8. What do you usually do in your flat?**

> See 5.

**9. What kinds of accommodation do you live in?**

> See 1.

**10. Do you plan to live there for a long time?**

> See 6.

**11. Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?**

> I’m not so sure about what it is like living in a house because I have never lived in a house before. But I do feel that there is lots of housework to do living in a house, like mowing the lawn, maintaining fixtures, shoveling the snow, just to name a few. You don’t need to worry about any of those living in a flat since the strata will take care of it. As a busy person myself, I’m not ready for all those extra housework.

**12. Are the transport facilities to your home very good?**

> I’ve honestly been very satisfied with transportation in Beijing. There’re many buses and subway lines very close-by. I can get to wherever I need to go pretty easily. I also really like the shared bikes in Beijing. They make it pretty easy for me to get around.

**13. What kind of house or flat do you want to live in in the future?**

> I want to live in a modern apartment with all the bells and whistles, all the most up-to-date technology like home automation. I think having a smart home can really make me feel like that I’m a boss at home because I can simply ask the virtual assistant to turn on and off a certain appliance.

**14. What's your favorite room in your apartment/house?**

> See 5.

**15. What makes you feel pleasant in your home?**

> Spending time with family for sure. I’m studying far away from home, so I only visit family during the holidays. I already feel that I’m spending so little time with my parents, and they are getting lonely when I’m not around. Now, I really treasure our movie nights at home!

**16. What's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?**

> The place where I am living in now is much quieter than where I lived before. The apartment I am living in now does not have as many people living in as where I grew up. In the apartment where I grew up, I was surrounded by all the members of my large family.

**17. Do you think it is important to live in a comfortable environment?**

> No doubt! This question is weird. Why on earth would anyone want to live in an uncomfortable environment? A comfy place will allow you to focus better and make you calm, and more importantly, happier!
