# P1 必考题

## Work or studies

**1. Do you work or are you a student?**

我是...的学生，我准备留学，这是我来考试的原因

> Well. I'm a full time college student at Beijing Jiaotong University. I'm planning to study abroad, and that's why I'm taking the test today.

**2. What subjects are you studying?**

主修软件工程，想成为程序员和拥有自己的公司。不得不说，课程比我想象的复杂，但我会坚持

> I'm majoring in Software Engineering because I want to become a programmer, and have my own IT company down the road. I have to say, the courses are much more complex than I expected. But, I'm hanging in there.

**3. Do you like your subject?**

当然，我想成为程序员，因为使用软件科技帮助社会有意义，课程有用，打基础

> Absolutely, like I said, I want to become a programmer in the future because I think that it makes sense to use software technology to help society develop better. All the courses I have taken at college are super useful, and are building up my foundation to achieve that goal.

**4. Why did you choose to study that subject?**

> see 2 or 3

**5. Is it very interesting?**

编程不止敲代码，更是科技产品的基础，给人带来便捷和幸福

> Absolutely, programming is much more than typing the code. In fact, it's the foundation of almost all the technological products we can see today. It allows people to enjoy convenience and happiness.

**6. Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?**

早上，更清醒和好心情，读些文章是一天的好的开始

> I actually prefer to study in the mornings. People tend to have a quite clear mind and a good mood in the morning. So by reading some delightful articles I can have a good start of my day.

**7. Are you looking forward to working?**

是的，应用理论知识到实践中，花父母钱，是时候赚钱并回报

> Yes, of course. I cannot wait to **apply my theoretical knowledge into practice**. Also, I have spent so much of my parents’ money throughout my education. It’s time to make some money and perhaps **give back to them**.

**8. What technology do you use when you study?**

硬件笔记本，软件IDE，提供简单完整的开发环境

> In terms of hardware, I use my laptop the most. For software, it must be VScode, Pycharm and Intellij IDEA. In programming, we need develop applications on IDE, which means integrated development environment. They provide a simple and complete platform for us to develop.

## Home/accommodation

**1. Do you live in a house or a flat?**

三居室，大多都住公寓，人口多，好选择，看不到house

> I live in a three-bedroom apartment. I mean, most Chinese people live in an apartment. Because we have such a large population, living in apartment buildings that are closer to work is the ideal option. You can rarely find any houses in the city.

**2. Can you describe the place where you live?**

北京有很多资源和机会

> Well, I live in Beijing, the capital city of China. It has quite a few resources with lots of opportunities. 

**3. How long have you lived there?**

10年，五年级转学

> I have been living there for 10 years. Since I was in grade 5, I transferred to Beijing to continue my studies.

**4. Please describe the room you live in.**

10平米小房间，双人床，桌子，电竞椅。太小没橱柜，也没有海报和镜子因为妈

> I have a small room about 10 square meters in size. There is a queen bed, a desk, my gaming chair, and that’s about it. It does not have a walk-in closet due to its small size. Oh, and there isn’t any poster or mirror because my mom does not allow me to hang anything on the wall.

**5. What part of your home do you like the most?**

客厅，大电视，坐在沙发上和父母看电影很享受

> Definitely the living room. We just upgraded our TV to a 75 inch 8k OLED TV which cost us thousands of dollars. Sitting on our **comfy** leather couch and watching our favourite movie with my parents is super enjoyable.

**6. Who do you live with?**

在学期和舍友住，假期和父母，毕业有钱自己住，珍视隐私

> I’m still a student, so I live with dorm mates during the semester. On holidays, I will live with my parents and spend valuable time with them. However, I’m pretty sure I would want to live by myself once I’m graduated and able to afford a place. I value privacy a lot.

**7. What room does your family spend most of the time in?**

> See 5.

**8. What do you usually do in your flat?**

> See 5.

**9. What kinds of accommodation do you live in?**

**10. Do you plan to live there for a long time?**

**11. Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?**

没住过，要铲草坪、维护、铲雪，flat不需要担心，有物业，我很忙做不了

> I’m not so sure about what it is like living in a house because I have never lived in a house before. But I do feel that there is lots of housework to do living in a house, like mowing the lawn, maintaining fixtures, shoveling the snow, just to name a few. You don’t need to worry about any of those living in a flat since the strata will take care of it. As a busy person myself, I’m not ready for all those extra housework.

**12. Are the transport facilities to your home very good?**

北京好，公交地铁很近，随便去，共享单车，

> I’ve honestly been very satisfied with transportation in Beijing. There’re many buses and subway lines very close-by. I can get to wherever I need to go pretty easily. I also really like the shared bikes in Beijing. They make it pretty easy for me to get around.

**13. What kind of house or flat do you want to live in in the future?**

现代公寓，home自动化，智能家庭让我感觉是个boss，问虚拟助手打开或关闭某个电器

> I want to live in a modern apartment with all the bells and whistles, all the most up-to-date technology like home automation. I think having a smart home can really make me feel like that I’m a boss at home because I can simply ask the virtual assistant to turn on and off a certain appliance.

**14. What's your favorite room in your apartment/house?**

> See 5.

**15. What makes you feel pleasant in your home?**

跟家人一起度过，学习远离家，只在假期回家，不在父母身边感到孤独，珍视我们的movie nights

> Spending time with family for sure. I’m studying far away from home, so I only visit family during the holidays. I already feel that I’m spending so little time with my parents, and they are getting lonely when I’m not around. Now, I really treasure our movie nights at home!

**16. What's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past?**

比之前的清净，人比之前少，成长的公寓，都是大家庭成员

> The place where I am living in now is much quieter than where I lived before. The apartment I am living in now does not have as many people living in as where I grew up. In the apartment where I grew up, I was surrounded by all the members of my large family.

**17. Do you think it is important to live in a comfortable environment?**

当然，怎么有人想要在不舒服的环境中生活，舒适的环境可以更专注、冷静和幸福

> No doubt! This question is weird. Why on earth would anyone want to live in an uncomfortable environment? A comfy place will allow you to focus better and make you calm, and more importantly, happier!

## Hometown

**1. Where is your hometown?**

200w小城市，中国中部的城市中心，没风景，但有人情

地理上很大，但都居住在市中心就很小，剩下的是农田

**5. Is there anything you dislike about it?**

虽然发展很快，没有高薪工作，5000元/月，很难省钱买车、房

> Although the city has been growing quite rapidly in recent years, there aren’t many high paying jobs. Most people make about 5,000 RMB a month which is about $1,000, so it’s still quite difficult to save enough money for a car or a house.

**6. How long have you been living there?**

12年，走出舒适区搬到北京寻找更多机会

**15. What are some changes in the area recently?**

体育馆，地标，外部和周围整晚照明，漂亮

北京搬好几次，上次5年前，忙于学习，没时间了解
