The two table give information about sales of Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004 in five European countries.

The sales figures of the UK grew considerably from 1.5 to 20 million euros in these five years, while in Switzerland sales only rose from 3 to 6 million euros. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden increased slightly from 1.8 to 2 million euros, from 1 to 1.7 million euros and from 0.8 to 1 million euros respectively. The different sales values from 1999 to 2004 in these three countries were all less than 1 million euros.

We can see from the second table that Switzerland bought far more bananas than the other countries.  Swiss sales figures rose sharply from 15 to 47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1 to 5.5 million euros and from 0.6 to 4 million euros. Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in bananas sales from 1.8 to 1 million euros and from 2 to 0.9 million euros.

The process diagram illustrates the manufacturing process for making sugar from sugar cane.

There are seven main stages in the manufacturing process. The process begins with the growing of sugar canes which takes 12 to 18 months. At the second stage in the process, the sugar canes have already been ripe, and the farmers need to use large equipment for harvesting to collect them, like tractor. After this, the sugar canes are crushed into juice and then they are transferred into the limestone filter for purifying. At the fifth stage, the purifying juice is heated in the evaporator to become syrup. At the following stage of the process, the syrup is centrifuged to separated sugar crystal from syrup. Finally, when sugar crystals are dried and cooled, they becomes sugar.

Overall, the process diagram shows that the whole procedures to making sugar from sugar cane.

```
The two diagrams illustrate the expected development of an industrial region in the town Norbiton. 

In the first map, a river running from the west to the east is in the north, north of which is farmland but on the other side is the industrial area. In the middle, there is a roundabout with two exits, one of which links to a main road in the south and the other is oriented to the east, and some factories are scattered on both sides of it. More factories are arranged around the roundabout. In the west of the industrial area, it is the town.

Turning to the second, a new exit to the north and connecting a road in front of some houses is likely to be added to the roundabout, and by then the farmland will shrink. On the west of it, there will be a few houses and shops while on the east, besides a playground to be constructed in a newly built residential area, a medical centre will also be in place. In the far east, a school is planned. On the main road, a new roundabout will be installed there, connecting the one in the middle.

Overall, this area will completely be converted into a residential block, with amenities and more roads to be established.
