The two table give information about sales of Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004 in five European countries.

The first table shows that sales of coffee increased in all five countries. The sales figures of the UK grew considerably from 1.5 to 20 million euros in these five years, while in Switzerland sales only rose from 3 to 6 million euros. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden increased slightly from 1.8 to 2 million euros, from 1 to 1.7 million euros and from 0.8 to 1 million euros respectively. The different sales values from 1999 to 2004 in these three countries were all less than 1 million euros.

We can see from the second table that Switzerland bought far more bananas than the other countries.  Swiss sales figures rose sharply from 15 to 47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1 to 5.5 million euros and from 0.6 to 4 million euros. Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in bananas sales from 1.8 to 1 million euros and from 2 to 0.9 million euros.

Overall, the first table shows an upward trend of the sales of coffee in five European countries, but the sales of bananas rose only in Switzerland, the UK and Belgium, while Sweden and Denmark sales dropped slightly.
