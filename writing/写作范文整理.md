The sales figures of the UK grew considerably from 1.5 to 20 million euros in these five years, while in Switzerland sales only rose from 3 to 6 million euros. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden increased slightly from 1.8 to 2 million euros, from 1 to 1.7 million euros and from 0.8 to 1 million euros respectively. The different sales values from 1999 to 2004 in these three countries were all less than 1 million euros.

We can see from the second table that Switzerland bought far more bananas than the other countries.  Swiss sales figures rose sharply from 15 to 47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1 to 5.5 million euros and from 0.6 to 4 million euros. Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in bananas sales from 1.8 to 1 million euros and from 2 to 0.9 million euros.

Overall, the first table shows an upward trend of the sales of coffee in five European countries, but the sales of bananas rose only in Switzerland, the UK and Belgium, while Sweden and Denmark sales dropped slightly.

The process diagram illustrates the manufacturing process for making sugar from sugar cane.

There are seven main stages in the manufacturing process. The process begins with the growing of sugar canes which takes 12 to 18 months. At the second stage in the process, the sugar canes have already been ripe, and the farmers need to use large equipment for harvesting to collect them, like tractor. After this, the sugar canes are crushed into juice and then they are transferred into the limestone filter for purifying. At the fifth stage, the purifying juice is heated in the evaporator to become syrup. At the following stage of the process, the syrup is centrifuged to separated sugar crystal from syrup. Finally, when sugar crystals are dried and cooled, they becomes sugar.

Overall, the process diagram shows that the whole procedures to making sugar from sugar cane.

The two diagrams illustrate the expected development of an industrial region in the town Norbiton. 

In the first map, a river running from the west to the east is in the north, north of which is farmland but on the other side is the industrial area. In the middle, there is a roundabout with two exits, one of which links to a main road in the south and the other is oriented to the east, and some factories are scattered on both sides of it. More factories are arranged around the roundabout. In the west of the industrial area, it is the town.

Turning to the second, a new exit to the north and connecting a road in front of some houses is likely to be added to the roundabout, and by then the farmland will shrink. On the west of it, there will be a few houses and shops while on the east, besides a playground to be constructed in a newly built residential area, a medical centre will also be in place. In the far east, a school is planned. On the main road, a new roundabout will be installed there, connecting the one in the middle.

Overall, this area will completely be converted into a residential block, with amenities and more roads to be established.

# Task 2

## Agree or disagree 是否同意

***Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugar, which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar.***

***Do you agree or disagree?***

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

```
In recent decades, the food and drink products which contain high levels of sugar leads many diseases. Although I agree that sugary products should be more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar, I believe that raising the price of sugary products cannot completely solve people's health problems.

On the one hand, one of the main reasons for the excessive consumption of sugary products and drinks is their low cost.  Therefore, increasing the price of sugary products would be a proven method of reducing their overall consumption.  A recent study conducted by the World Health Organization reveals that a 20% price increase in sugary drinks resulted in as much as a 15% decrease in their consumption in just six months.  It is very logical that, when sugary products will be expensive, many people will be less likely to indulge in them as frequently, and will instead opt for healthier alternatives.  This will be particularly beneficial for low-income individuals, who are disproportionately affected by obesity and related health problems due to their reliance on cheap, unhealthy food.

On the other hand, I believe that raising the price of sugary products cannot completely solve people's health problems. Instead of raising the price of sugary products and imposing a heavy tax on the manufacturers, a more effective approach would be to educate people about the harm of excessive intake of sugar and sugary items. The school curriculum and social campaigns should emphasize how eating healthy can make our life positive in many perspectives. Promoting healthier food options in schools, office canteens and public places, for example, could be a far better approach. 

In conclusion, although the increasing price of sugary products can lead to consume less sugar, I believe that education and society activities can be more effectively to solve people's health problems.

## Discuss both view and Give your own opinion 双边讨论

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.
Write about the following topic:

**Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish.  Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.

Some people think that professionals, like doctors and engineers, should work in the country where they trained. However, I support the view that professionals should be free to work in another country if they want.

There are two main reasons why some people argue that professionals should work in the country where they trained.  They believe that professionals are fostered by their country and their country spend a large amount of money to train them. It is not worth for their country. For example, a medical student who study in China needs 8 years to gain a comprehensive skill in medicine. In these 8 years, government provide money for their medical equipment, lab and daily allowance. Also, more and more professionals work in another country leads the lack of the people who have the ability in professional field. It is a dangerous situation for a country, which not only restrict the development of it, but also decrease the strength and influence of it, which means attract less professionals.

However, I agree with the view that professionals should be free to work in another country if they want. Some people pay for their own training courses, so they do not have a duty to contribute to the training country. Furthermore, Freedom is everyone's right, of course, it is also the professionals' right. Their free make them choose a better opportunity or environment which is more likely to improve their talents and skills. For instance, medical professionals can obtain and study first-hand information on diseases that are specific to a particular locality. In addition, more research results can be obtained if another country can support professionals with advanced facilities. 

In conclusion, although some people argue that professionals should work in the country where they did their training, I believe that it is much better for the whole society to let professionals be free to work in another country if they wish.

## Advantage and Disadvantage 比较利弊

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.
Write about the following topic:

**It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives.Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages?**

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.

```
Some people think it is important for them to take risks in their professional lives and their personal lives. I believe that the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages.

On the one hand, taking risks has some disadvantages. This action always make people are in a dangerous situation. Once they cannot solve the problems approximately, their safeties are affected. For example, there are many students study abroad. What they do is a kind of taking risk and their safety cannot sure in a foreign country because of unfamiliar environments or the culture. Also, the people who take risks must go out of their comfort zone, which means they may lose their happiness and feel sadness.

On the other hand, in our professional lives, taking risks can lead to new opportunities and career advancement. For example, an individual may take the risk of applying for a new job that is outside of their comfort zone, but the potential reward of getting the job and gaining new skills and experiences can outweigh the potential negative consequences of not getting the job. Similarly, taking risks in the business world, such as investing in a new technology or entering a new market, can lead to innovation and growth for the company.

Furthermore, in our personal lives, taking risks can lead to personal growth and self-improvement. For example, an individual may take the risk of trying a new hobby or pursuing a new passion, and even if they do not succeed, the experience and self-discovery that comes from taking that risk can be valuable. Additionally, taking risks in our personal relationships, such as expressing our true feelings to someone or pursuing a new romantic relationship, can lead to increased happiness and fulfillment in our lives.

In conclusion, while some may argue that the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages, I believe that the disadvantages often outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, it is important for individuals to carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before taking risks in their personal or professional lives.

## Report 分析

**In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.**

**What are the reasons for this?**

**How can people research this?**

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

```
In some countries, many people are interested in  finding out about the history of their house which they live in. There are several cause of this trend and relative research methods are presented below.

An increasing amount of people declare that they are fond of history for their pride in and curiosity about the earlier past. So, tracing the background of where they live could be deemed a convenient and easier start. For instance, residents in cities or places rich in culture may find specially designed buildings typifying the rich extremes of local architecture, such as statues, arches, materials, etc., which would bring them back to ancient culture and history where they may feel themselves there. Also, learning local history is a smart way to boost belongingness to communities, because people may find themselves attracted in their journey of historical discovery, by either appealing legends or civilization.

A person who well knows local buildings or houses should be a good key to the answers, who is highly possible to narrate an intriguing local story. Whether the story is true or made-up, it more or less reveals local customs to its audience. Filed local documents in the library could also serve as appropriate means of exploring and generating insights into the history, as they may have recorded complete details of buildings’ origin, including past residents and their stories.

To sum up, local people and files could pave the way for finding history, especially the one of their accommodations.
